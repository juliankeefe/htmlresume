  <h2> Prime Digital Academy Web Resume </h2>
<p class="about-me">Hello PrimeAcademy! My name is Julian Keefe, and I am a current business/design/ tech hybrid looking to make the leap into
                full time development. I have experience in UX/ UI design, became involved in my univiersity's startup ecosysystem, and currently
                work at a top Salesforce implementation firm helping companies move their IT infrastructure to the cloud. My ultimate dream in learning
                to code is to be able to bring my side-projects from wireframes to fully functional web applications, and work at a company or startup
                that I believe in the mission and team.

                around learning hobbies and skills using the Internet and good design. As part of my senior
                capstone project, myself and two other classmates created an iOS app. I served as the priamry UI
                designer and also worked on creating the database for the app. Listed is an updated UI for a Web

              the growing podcast market. I created this with 2 other classmates as part of a PHP course, and also created mockups for
              a fully -featured version that would incorporate APIs and social sharing to allow users to share notes and connect
              with content creaters.

              suggested Prime Academy to me) as part of a student entreprenurship competition @ IU know as the
              BEST Program. We were one of 3 teams selected and granted with $5,000 in funding to bring our concept
              to life. The application allowed schools and community centers to rent out their basketball gyms for
              pickup games for members on our platform. While we had mild success, the project was put on hold
              due to lack of proper infrastructure. This experience was a huge motivator for me to learn to how
              to program as I was able to create a successful MVP with mild hype, but was held back by not being
              able to scale.
